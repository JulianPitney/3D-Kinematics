# Kinarena

Kinarena is a system for performing 3D kinematic analysis on rodents. The 3D reconstruction is marker-less, fully automatic, covers 360° around the animal at all times and is highly accurate. 

The system is an "end-to-end solution". This means that we provide:

* Arena optimized for rodent kinematics.
* Hardware synchronized camera system optimized for rodent kinematics.
* I.R lighting for even and diffuse lighting in "night" or "day" conditions.
* Hardware for securely mounting the cameras and lights to the arena.
* Software for automatic 3D reconstruction with 360° coverage at all times.
* Analysis software for generating meaningful conclusions from the data.
* Trained network and camera  calibration files. (If you're using our hardware there is no need to train your own network or perform your own camera calibration)

The goal of this project is to provide a system that generates meaningful "graph-ready" behavioral data at the push of a button.
